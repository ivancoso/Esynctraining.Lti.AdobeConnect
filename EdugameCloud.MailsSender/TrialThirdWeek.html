        <p style="margin: 0 0 18px 0;">Hi @Model.FirstName,</p>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 18px 0;">
            As you start your second week with EduGame Cloud, I wanted to provide you with design tips for making your virtual training event more engaging with EduGame Cloud. Below is a sample 1-hour event that features high-level of user engagement with assessment activities:
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 18px 0;"><img src="cid:TrialThirdWeek" />
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 18px 0;">
            In this 1-hour design we see two larger chunks of presentation material with five engagement activities sprinkled throughout. This maximizes user engagement and provides reinforcement of the material after 15-20 minutes of lecture material is presented. Always strive to add engagement frequently to keep the student involved with the training content. Passive learners that are not required to engage will have much lower retention rates with the training material. Virtual training is a much quicker pace of slide changes, animations and annotations – with something happening on the screen constantly. 
        </p>

            Good luck with your virtual learning!!! If you have any questions, please contact me at:<br />
